# JS Questions for IHS Markit prelim rounds

I gave this interview on 29/07/22 and unfortunately due to no prep at all, I was
not able to give satisfactory answers.

But this gave me an insight on what areas I want to improve - particularly coding 
in JS. Problems that are very simple but people like me falter in answering them
in interviews.
